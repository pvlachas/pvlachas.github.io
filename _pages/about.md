Hi!

I'm Pantelis, currently leading the Machine Learning Research team at [AI2C Technologies](https://www.ai2c.ch), a spin-off from ETH working on novel machine learning solutions for fintech.
In parallel, I am affiliated with ETH Zurich, with the group of [Prof. Eleni Chatzi](https://chatzi.ibk.ethz.ch), where I am exploring adaptive surrogate models of dynamical systems with online and real-time learning capabilities.

I completed my Ph.D. under the supervision of [Prof. Petros Koumoutsakos](https://cse-lab.seas.harvard.edu) in the CSE Lab in Zurich.
There I worked on novel efficient methods for learning effective dynamics of complex systems.
We demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed methods in a wide range of applications from systems that exhibit spatiotemporal chaotic behavior and turbulent flows to small molecules.
During my Ph.D. I also visited the [John A. Paulson School Of Engineering And Applied Sciences](https://seas.harvard.edu) in Harvard as an Associate Researcher.

Feel free to reach out!
