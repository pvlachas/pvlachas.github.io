Hi there!

I'm Pantelis, currently leading the Machine Learning Research team at AI2C Technologies, a spin-off from ETH working on novel machine learning solutions for fintech.
In parallel, I am affiliated with ETH Zurich, with the group of [Prof. Eleni Chatzi](https://chatzi.ibk.ethz.ch), where I am exploring adaptive reduced order models with online learning capabilities.
I completed my Ph.D. under the supervision of [Prof. Petros Koumoutsakos](https://cse-lab.seas.harvard.edu) in the CSE Lab in Zurich, where I worked on developing novel efficient methods for learning effective dynamics of complex systems, that can be applied in a wide range of systems, from chaotic, turbulent dynamics to small molecules.

Feel free to reach out.
