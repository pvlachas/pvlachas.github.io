# Personal Academic Website â€” Pantelis R. Vlachas

This repository hosts my personal academic and research website, built using the **[al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio)** Jekyll theme.

The site presents my professional profile, research interests, publications, and projects in a clean and minimal format inspired by al-folio.  
It has been customized to reflect my academic work, style preferences, and layout adjustments.
