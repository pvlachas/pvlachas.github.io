I will be giving a talk on [PHLieNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19609) at the [joint 5th Symposium on Machine Learning and Dynamical Systems (MLDS 5) and Differential Equations for Data Science (DEDS 2026)](https://sites.google.com/site/boumedienehamzi/fifth-symposium-on-machine-learning-and-dynamical-systems).

The event will take place at the **Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences (RIMS), Kyoto University**, from **February 9â€“13, 2026**.

This symposium brings together researchers at the intersection of **machine 
learning**, **dynamical systems**, and **mathematical modeling**, an ideal venue to 
discuss how PHLieNets can enable scalable and generalizable learning across parametric dynamical systems.
