I gave a talk at the [Third Symposium on Machine Learning and Dynamical Systems](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/22-23/3rd-machine-learning) in Toronto. Very interesting conference with lots of remarkable talks organized by [Boumediene Hamzi](https://sites.google.com/site/boumedienehamzi/home). Link to the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8pIKPBykJU&t=1s).
