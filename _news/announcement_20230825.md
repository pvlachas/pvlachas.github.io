My colleagues [Pascal Weber](https://www.cse-lab.ethz.ch/member/pascal-weber/) and [Michalis Chatzimanolakis](https://www.cse-lab.ethz.ch/member/michalis-chatzimanolakis/) successfully defended their PhDs! Their work on [Reinforcement learning for fish schooling behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10548) and [adaptive mesh refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07345) has been remarkable (and also quite cool).
