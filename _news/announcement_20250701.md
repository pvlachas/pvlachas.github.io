I will be presenting a poster at the [Greeks in AI Symposium 2025](https://www.greeksin.ai), which will take place at **Serafeio City of Athens**, Greece, on **July 19â€“20, 2025**.  

The poster will showcase [PHLieNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19609), a framework for learning parametric dynamical systems through hypernetworks and latent embeddings for long-term forecasting.
